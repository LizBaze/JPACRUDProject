# JPACRUDProject

### Description
This is a fairly straightforward full-stack project. There is a database created using MySQL Workbench that tracks musicians/bands linked with a front-end web page that allows users to view individual entries, search by keyword or genre, make updates to artists, and delete entire entries.

### Technology Used
- MySQL
- JAVA
- JPQL
- JPA
- JSP Expression Language
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap
- SpringBoot

### Lessons Learned
- It pays to have a plan before you start. If you just jump in, do what whatever works, and add features as you go, it's easy to end up with an unreadable mess.
- Heed the warning not to use reserved keywords as column names in your database.
- Managed vs Detached entities
